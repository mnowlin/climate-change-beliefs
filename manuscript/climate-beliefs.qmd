# Introduction 

Climate change remains one of the most politically polarized issues, particularly in the United States. Sharp divides exist among the public and policy elites regarding the existence of climate change, the extent of its risk, and what, if anything, should be done to address it. A consequence of political divides regarding climate change is stymied progress in reducing greenhouse gas emissions.

There are several explanations for why the public remains divided on climate change, including political ideology and partisanship; cultural worldviews derived from cultural theory; environmental orientation; acceptance/rejection of the scientific consensus on climate change; and an aversion to government regulations meant to address climate change. Each explanation involves beliefs about climate change, yet these beliefs do not exist in isolation from one another. Beliefs about climate change form an interconnected belief system.

A belief system is a set of interrelated and connected beliefs. One way to understand belief systems is to view them as existing within a hierarchy, in which higher-order beliefs influence or constrain lower-order beliefs [@peffleyHierarchicalModelAttitude1985; @nohrstedtAdvocacyCoalitionFramework2023; @sabatierPolicyChangeLearning1993]. With the hierarchical approach to belief systems, the most abstract beliefs and general principles, termed _deep core beliefs_ (e.g., political ideology), inform less abstract views about policy issues, _policy core beliefs_ (e.g., climate change is happening), as well as attitudes about specific policy approaches, or _secondary beliefs_ (e.g., support for a carbon tax). A second way of understanding belief systems is that of a network of connected beliefs [@boutylineBeliefNetworkAnalysis2017; @brandtWhatCentralPolitical2019; @fishmanChangeWeCan2022; @brandtEvaluatingBeliefSystem2021]. Similar to other types of networks, belief system networks have _nodes_, which are the beliefs, and _edges_, which are the connections, or relationships, between beliefs. Belief system networks can be analyzed using centrality measures to understand the importance and influence of the various beliefs (i.e., nodes). 

Examining the public's climate change beliefs as a network can yield insights into polarized views. Indeed, several recent studies have examined the climate change belief system network [@leeClimateChangeBelief2024; @leeVariationsClimateChange2025; @lindComparingAttitudinalStructures2024; @stewartMappingRacialEthnic2024; @verschoorExploringRelationshipsClimate2020a]. However, apart from political ideology and partisanship, these studies did not include measures of other deep core beliefs such as cultural worldviews and environmental orientation, which have been shown to influence climate change beliefs [@jonesLeadingWayCompromise2011; @zieglerPoliticalOrientationEnvironmental2017; @nowlinCulturalTheoryPartisanship2020]. 

In this paper, I use original survey data to examine the climate change belief system using measures of various types of beliefs not measured in previous research, including core beliefs (cultural worldviews, political ideology, partisanship, environment orientation), policy domain beliefs (views about climate change), and views on various policies to address climate change. By examining the climate change belief network, I can determine which beliefs are the most central within it. This allows comparison between the various leading explanations for the public's divergent views on climate. For example, if a recognition of the scientific consensus has high centrality in the network, that would indicate that the scientific consensus is a "gateway belief" that shapes other beliefs about climate change [@vanderlindenGatewayBeliefModel2021].    

Using common measures of network centrality, including strength, closeness, and betweenness, I find that cultural worldviews, specifically egalitarianism (a deep core belief), support for EPA regulations (a secondary belief), and perceptions of climate change risk (a policy core belief) are the most central beliefs in the network. However, the centrality of beliefs varied across the different centrality measures, indicating that different types of beliefs serve different functions within a belief system network. For example, egalitarianism had the highest betweenness and closeness centrality among all respondents, indicating that it served as a bridge connecting other beliefs in the network. Yet, support for EPA regulations, a policy preference, had the highest strength centrality, meaning that it had the strongest connections (i.e., highest partial corrections with other nodes) in the network.


# Belief Systems and Belief System Networks

Beliefs are propositions taken to be true, and the interconnections among them form a belief system. Early work on belief systems by @converseNatureBeliefSystems1964a noted that belief systems consist of a "configuration of ideas and attitudes in which the elements are bound together by some form of constraint or functional interdependence" (3). Constraint or interdependence among idea-elements (i.e., beliefs) within a belief system means that one belief influences others, and a change in one belief is associated with a change in another. @converseNatureBeliefSystems1964a also noted that beliefs can vary by centrality, where a belief that is "central" is less likely to change than a belief that is less central. More recently, @brandtEvaluatingBeliefSystem2021 argued that a theory of belief systems must contain three elements: a) the components of the belief system must be connected; b) these connections should be causal; and c) contain an accounting of the potential impacts of exogenous factors. 
 
An early approach to understanding belief systems posited that belief systems have a hierarchical structure where higher-order beliefs, which are abstract beliefs and values, connect to and constrain lower-order beliefs about specific issues [ e.g., @hurwitzHowAreForeign1987; @hurwitzTraditionalSocialValues1992; @peffleyHierarchicalModelAttitude1985]. Building on this work, policy scholars using the Advocacy Coalition Framework (ACF) have noted the importance of beliefs, structured hierarchically, for forming and maintaining advocacy coalitions, policy learning, and policy change [@nohrstedtAdvocacyCoalitionFramework2023; @sabatierPolicyChangeLearning1993]. Using ACF terminology, beliefs at the top of the hierarchy are known as deep core beliefs and can include political ideology, cultural worldviews, and environmental values, among others. 

Deep core beliefs are foundational values that are sufficiently abstract that they can inform views on a variety of policy issues. As noted by @jenkins-smithBeliefSystemContinuity2014, core beliefs are:

> combinations of beliefs about broad societal norms concerning the role of government vs. the market in society, beliefs about the appropriate balance of expertise and centralized authority vs. communal or consensus-based decision making, and views about the relative priority of values such as liberty, equality, and security (492).

Additionally, deep core beliefs are central beliefs in the @converseNatureBeliefSystems1964a sense and are, therefore, resistant to change. Finally, they act as filters for how information about policy issues is processed [@kahanCulturalCognitionConception2012; @nowlinPolicyLearningInformation2021]. 

While deep core beliefs have been measured in various ways, increasingly scholars are using cultural worldviews developed from cultural theory to conceptualize and measure them [@ripbergerCulturalTheoryMeasurement2014; @jenkins-smithBeliefSystemContinuity2014; @hornungPartyIdentificationCultural2021; @sotirovCognitiveTheoryShifting2016; @nohrstedtAdvocacyCoalitionFramework2023]. In brief, cultural theory posits four cultural worldviews, or cultural types, which are derived from ideas about how societal relationships should ideally be structured. The four cultural types include _hierarchs_, who value clear lines of authority and rules that guide individual behavior; _egalitarians_, who value equality and collective well-being; _individualists_, who value autonomy and individual choice; and _fatalists_, who see the world as capricious and beyond human control. An individual's cultural worldview has been shown to inform their views on a host of specific policy issues, including national security [@ripbergerHowCulturalOrientations2011]; gun control [@kahanMoreStatisticsLess2003]; trade-offs between rights and security [@jenkins-smithRockHardPlace2009]; immigration [@jacksonTheoryPreferenceFormation2015]; vaccines [@songUnderstandingPublicPerceptions2014]; and climate change [@jonesLeadingWayCompromise2011; @nowlinCulturalTheoryPartisanship2020; @kahanPolarizingImpactScience2012].    

Following deep core beliefs are _policy core beliefs_ that involve beliefs about particular policy issues such as immigration, national security, or climate change. Policy core beliefs are influenced by deep core beliefs. Finally, _secondary beliefs_ are beliefs regarding policy approaches such as a carbon tax or Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) regulations. Secondary beliefs are influenced by both deep core and policy core beliefs. 

The hierarchical structure of beliefs includes the necessary elements of a theory of belief systems outlined by @brandtEvaluatingBeliefSystem2021, as the belief system components are connected and causality runs from higher-order (deep core) to lower-order (secondary) beliefs. Yet, one issue with the hierarchical structure conceptualization is that the boundaries between different types of beliefs are fuzzy. In addition, each type of belief has been measured in different ways, leading to different conclusions among scholars about belief systems [@henryAdvocacyCoalitionFramework2022; @ripbergerCulturalTheoryMeasurement2014]. Conceptualizing belief systems as a network provides another way to understand their structure and organization that doesn’t rely on hierarchical, vertical relationships among different types of beliefs. A network approach emphasizes the horizontal connections between different beliefs, and the influence of a belief on other beliefs is based on measures of centrality rather than their place in a hierarchy. 

## Belief System Networks

Within a belief system network, the components of the belief system -- beliefs -- are understood as _nodes_, and the connections between beliefs are _edges_ or _ties_. Understanding belief systems as networks provides a way to operationalize belief systems consistent with how they are commonly defined and understood, and belief system networks can be analyzed using network centrality measures to determine which beliefs are prominent and influential in the network [@epskampEstimatingPsychologicalNetworks2018; @verschoorExploringRelationshipsClimate2020a; @fishmanChangeWeCan2022; @brandtEvaluatingBeliefSystem2021; @caminaHubsBeliefNetworks2022; @keskinturkOrganizationPoliticalBelief2022; @turner-zwinkelsBeliefSystemNetworks2022]. 

A network approach can retain the notion of various "types" of beliefs (i.e., deep core, policy core, secondary) but shift the focus from their location in the hierarchy to their centrality in a belief system network. The centrality of the various types of beliefs highlights their importance and the function they perform in connecting other beliefs. Several studies have illustrated the usefulness of conceptualizing belief systems as networks, and many have found that "symbolic" beliefs (e.g., deep core beliefs such as political ideology) have high centrality values in belief system networks [@fishmanChangeWeCan2022]. For example, using the American National Election Study (ANES), @boutylineBeliefNetworkAnalysis2017 found that self-reported political ideology occupies a central role in a network of other beliefs about various policy issues (abortion, environment, guns, death penalty, immigration, inequality, welfare spending). Additionally, using common measures of network centrality, @brandtWhatCentralPolitical2019 find that symbolic beliefs based on identities (political ideology and partisanship) are more central within belief system networks than operational (issues-based) beliefs. 
 
Beliefs that are more central in a belief system network keep an otherwise potentially disparate set of beliefs connected. Work by @boutylineBeliefNetworkAnalysis2017 posited a belief system network model where: 

> (a) Individuals start with a single central belief ... (b) This central belief is used to produce a number of broad stances ..., which are then used to stochastically produce further beliefs. (c) Newly added sets of beliefs then form the basis for yet newer and more specific beliefs, repeating recursively to yield a center-periphery structure (1378-1379)

As the belief system forms a center-periphery structure, some beliefs can begin to act as bridges, connecting beliefs in the periphery to other beliefs in the network. Specifically, _betweenness_ centrality measures how beliefs in the core of the network connect to those in the periphery. Multiple measures of centrality are typically used to determine the prominence of various beliefs in a belief system network. The most common measures of centrality, apart from betweenness, include _closeness_ and _degree (strength)_. Each measure of centrality places distinct emphasis on what makes a node more or less important in the network, and that emphasis illustrates the function of the belief in the network.  
 
Betweenness centrality measures the extent to which a node lies on paths between other nodes. A node high in betweenness is thought to be important because it reduces the distance between other nodes and, therefore, becomes an important link, or gatekeeper, to the other nodes (beliefs). The betweenness centrality equation for node _n_$_i$ is 

$$
\textit{C}_B (n_i) = \sum_{j<k} \frac{g_{jk}(n_i)}{g_{jk}} 
$$

where _g_$_{jk}$ is the geodesic, or shortest path between nodes _j_ and _k_, and _g_$_{jk}$(_n_$_i$) is the number of shortest paths where _n_$_i$ is present [@quintanaSingleAttitudesBelief2023; @lukeUserGuideNetwork2015]. Beliefs that are high in betweenness centrality connect nodes in complex, center-periphery networks.

Closeness centrality measures how close nodes are in a network. Nodes that are closer to several other nodes are thought to be influential because the path from them to other nodes is short, which allows the node to more readily influence other nodes through a direct effect. The equation for the closeness centrality of node _n_$_i$ is 

$$
\textit{C}_C (n_i) = \left[\sum_{j=1}^{g}d(n_i,n_j)\right]^{-1}
$$

where _d_ is the distance between nodes. Closeness centrality is the inverse of the sum of distances between _n_$_i$ and the other nodes in the network [@quintanaSingleAttitudesBelief2023; @lukeUserGuideNetwork2015]. A larger value for closeness centrality indicates shorter distances to other nodes, which allows a belief to quickly influence other beliefs.  

Degree centrality measures the number of direct connections to a node, with more connections being indicating the node's prominence and importance. Strength centrality is associated with degree centrality, but degree centrality is used in unweighted networks, or networks where connections are binary (i.e., yes or no), and strength centrality is used in weighted networks, where connections have a value, or weight, that denotes the strength of the connections. Specifically, strength centrality is calculated as the sum of the weights, rather than the sum of the connections, as in degree centrality. This means that nodes with high strength centrality are well-connected to other nodes.

In the following analysis, I examine the network of beliefs about climate change of a quota-based sample of the US public. Next, I briefly describe several drivers of the public's views on climate change.   

# Climate Change Beliefs

Even as climate scientists agree that climate change is happening, is anthropogenic, and poses significant risks, opinions are divided on each of those questions among some elites and some of the public. Several factors have been shown to influence beliefs about climate change among the public, including deep core beliefs such as partisanship, ideology, cultural worldviews, environmental attitudes, as well as policy core beliefs, including views about the scientific consensus, and secondary beliefs associated with aversions to the solutions presented to address climate change. 

Perhaps the clearest divides regarding climate change are connected to political beliefs. Several studies have shown that, among the mass public in the US, conservatives and Republicans are less likely than liberals and Democrats to believe that climate change is happening or poses a risk [@bugdenDenialDistrustExplaining2022;  @mccrightPoliticizationClimateChange2011]. Evidence suggests that polarization among the public is driven by elite polarization, as the public takes cues about policy and political issues from the political figures and news sources that they trust [@brulleShiftingPublicOpinion2012; @carmichaelEliteCuesMedia2017; @krosnickOriginsConsequencesDemocratic2006; @merkleyPartyCuesNews2021; @merkleyPartyElitesManufactured2018; @teslerEliteDominationPublic2018]. 

Apart from political beliefs, cultural worldviews derived from cultural theory have also been associated with climate beliefs. Early theorizing of cultural theory noted that the various cultural worldviews hold different "myths of nature", which shape how they view the natural environment and the risks posed to it [@thompsonCulturalTheory1990]. In brief, egalitarians tend to view nature as fragile and ephemeral, whereas individualists see nature as robust. Hierarchs tend to see nature as tolerant within limits that need to be carefully and expertly managed. Finally, fatalists see nature as random and unpredictable and therefore impossible for humans to manage [@grendstadCulturalMythsHuman2000]. The various myths of nature associated with cultural worldviews likely drive climate beliefs. Research has found that egalitarians are the most concerned about climate change, and individualists are the least concerned among the cultural types [@jonesLeadingWayCompromise2011; @verweijClumsySolutionsComplex2006; @kahanCulturalCognitionScientific2011; @kahanPolarizingImpactScience2012]. Hierarchs tend to occupy a "middle" space between egalitarians and individualists on environmental issues broadly [@ripbergerCulturalTheoryMeasurement2014] and climate change specifically [@nowlinCulturalTheoryPartisanship2020]. Finally, given their views on the capriciousness of nature, fatalists tend not to have clearly defined beliefs about climate change [@jonesLeadingWayCompromise2011; @nowlinCulturalTheoryPartisanship2020]. 
 
Broader environmental values and attitudes also shape views on climate change. One of the most commonly used measures of environmental orientation is the New Ecological Paradigm (NEP) scale [@dunlapNewEnvironmentalParadigm2008; @sternNewEcologicalParadigm1995; @sparksMeasuringEnvironmentalValues2021]. In brief, the NEP scale measures "beliefs about humanity’s ability to upset the balance of nature, the existence of limits to growth for human societies, and humanity’s right to rule over the rest of nature" [@dunlapNewTrendsMeasuring2000, 427]. Using the NEP scale, a pro-environmental orientation is associated with concerns about the robustness of nature and the impacts of human activities on the natural world. Previous research has found that a pro-environmental orientation, as measured by the NEP scale, is associated with views about climate change [@nowlinEnvironmentalPolicymakingEra2019; @zieglerPoliticalOrientationEnvironmental2017].

As noted, opinions differ on climate change despite the clear scientific consensus. A series of studies have found that acceptance of the scientific consensus around climate change acts as a "gateway belief" that connects to beliefs that climate change is happening and also connects to support for actions to address climate change [@goldbergExperienceConsensusVideo2019; @vanderlindenGatewayBeliefModel2019; @vanderlindenScientificConsensusClimate2015]. Using experimental research designs, scholars have found that those exposed to a message about the scientific consensus were more likely than those not exposed to a consensus message to change their beliefs regarding climate change (i.e., it's happening, it's anthropogenic, and it's a risk) as well as increase their support for public action [@vanderlindenGatewayBeliefModel2021]. 

Political beliefs are a leading source of division over climate change, and one explanation for their influence on both elites and the mass public is solution aversion [@campbellSolutionAversionRelation2014]. One of the underlying differences between Republicans/conservatives and Democrats/liberals is how they see the role of government, particularly the federal government, in addressing societal problems. Generally speaking, Republicans/conservatives are more skeptical of the government's ability to address problems than Democrats/liberals. Much of the discussion around climate change centers on government action to address it, and when government action is presented as a solution, it is likely to trigger skepticism among Republicans/conservatives, which in turn broadens skepticism about the problem. In essence, the solution aversion hypothesis posits that secondary beliefs and/or policy preferences drive broader views of policy issues. This is evidenced by the finding that the debate over the Kyoto Protocol polarized views about climate change [@krosnickImpactFall19972000].  

Recent research using a network approach to examine climate change beliefs found that how worried respondents are about climate change, a policy core belief, was the most central belief in the climate change belief network [@leeClimateChangeBelief2024]. Additionally, support for regulating greenhouse gas emissions (secondary belief/policy preference) and beliefs about potential harm resulting from climate change (policy core belief) also scored high on measures of network centrality. Other studies found differences in the structure of climate change belief networks across groups, including those in global south who tended to have less density connected networks than those in the north [@leeVariationsClimateChange2025], White, Black, and Hispanic respondents [@stewartMappingRacialEthnic2024], Republicans and Democrats [@leeClimateChangeBelief2024], and those on the political left vs the right in Denmark [@lindComparingAttitudinalStructures2024]. While these studies provide important insights into the climate change belief system of various publics, they did not include measures of many deep core beliefs shown to be important influences of climate change beliefs, including cultural worldviews and environmental orientation. 

## Hypotheses

Several hypotheses can be derived from previous research regarding the centrality of the various beliefs in the climate change belief network. First, deep core beliefs, such as cultural worldviews, political beliefs, and pro-environmental orientation, shape and constrain other beliefs and, therefore, are likely to have the highest levels of centrality in the network. 

> **H1**: Deep core beliefs will be the most central beliefs in the network 

A second expectation, derived from the work on the scientific consensus acting as a gateway belief, is that views on the scientific consensus would be the most central belief. 

> **H2**: Beliefs about the scientific concensus will be the most central belief in the network 

Finally, a third expectation, based on solution aversion, is that beliefs about policy approaches to climate change would be the most central because support or opposition to policy influences other climate beliefs. 

> **H3**: Beliefs about policy approaches will be the most central beliefs in the network 

In the next section, I discuss the data and measurements used to explore the climate change belief network.


# Data and Analysis 

To examine the belief system network around climate change, I use original public survey data collected in October 2017. The data comes from a representative sample, based on quotas for age, gender, and race/ethnicity drawn from the US Census, of about 1200 US residents obtained through Survey Sampling International (SSI). The survey was administered online through Qualtrics. Respondents were asked questions regarding their views on climate change, support for policy approaches to address climate change, agreement with statements from the New Ecological Paradigm (NEP), questions to determine their cultural worldview based on cultural theory, and their ideological and partisan attachments. 

## Belief Measures 

Cultural theory, political ideology, partisanship, and the NEP scale were used to measure survey respondents' deep core beliefs. Questions regarding the belief and certainty that climate change is happening, the risk posed by climate change. and whether or not a scientific consensus exists about climate change were used to measure the policy core beliefs of respondents. Finally, policy preferences, including support for several policy approaches to address climate change, including a carbon tax, cap-and-trade, EPA regulations, international agreements, geoengineering, and nuclear energy, were used to measure secondary beliefs. I describe each of the measures below.^[Summary statistics are shown in the appendix, @tbl-descript.]  

For cultural worldview measures, I rely on a standard set of survey questions used in many previous studies [e.g., @jonesLeadingWayCompromise2011; @moyerCulturalPredispositionsSpecific2019; @nowlinCulturalTheoryPartisanship2020; @tumlisonCulturalValuesTrust2019], which have been demonstrated to have convergent, discriminant, and predictive validity [@swedlowConstructValidityCultural2020]. Specifically, respondents rated their agreement with 12 statements on a 1 (strongly disagree) to 7 (strongly agree) scale, presented in random order. Of the 12 statements, three represented each of the four cultural types. The statements for each cultural worldview are presented below.  

The statements for the hierarchy worldview included: 

> - _The best way to get ahead in life is to work hard to do what you are told to do_
> - _Society is in trouble because people do not obey those in authority_ 
> - _Society would be much better off if we imposed strict and swift punishment on those who break the rules_ 

For egalitarianism, the statements included: 

> - _What society needs is a fairness revolution to make the distribution of goods more equal_
> - _Society works best if power is shared equally_
> - _It is our responsibility to reduce differences in income between the rich and the poor_ 

The individualism statements were:  

> - _Even if some people are at a disadvantage, it is best for society to let people succeed or fail on their own_
> - _Even the disadvantaged should have to make their own way in the world_
> - _We are all better off when we compete as individuals_

Finally, the fatalism statements included: 

> - _The most important things that take place in life happen by chance_
> - _No matter how hard we try, the course of our lives is largely determined by forces beyond our control_
> - _For the most part, succeeding in life is a matter of chance_

For analysis, I combined and averaged the three statements into a 1 to 7 scale for each worldview, with higher scores indicating greater agreement with the statements associated with that cultural type. The hierarchy scale has a mean (_M_) of `r round(mean(beliefData$hier, na.rm=TRUE),2)` and a standard deviation (_sd_) of `r round(sd(beliefData$hier, na.rm=TRUE),2)`. In terms of reliability, the hierarchy scale has a Cronbach's $\alpha$ = `r round(hierA$alpha,2)`. The egalitarianism scale has a _M_ = `r round(mean(beliefData$egal, na.rm=TRUE),2)`, _sd_ = `r round(sd(beliefData$egal, na.rm=TRUE),2)`, and a Cronbach's $\alpha$ = `r round(egalA$alpha,2)`. For the individualism scale, the _M_ = `r round(mean(beliefData$indiv, na.rm=TRUE),2)`, _sd_ = `r round(sd(beliefData$indiv, na.rm=TRUE),2)` and the Cronbach's $\alpha$ = `r round(indivA$alpha,2)`. Finally, the fatalism scale has a _M_ = `r round(mean(beliefData$fatal, na.rm=TRUE),2)`, _sd_ = `r round(sd(beliefData$fatal, na.rm=TRUE),2)`, and a Cronbach's $\alpha$ = `r round(fatalA$alpha,2)`. Overall, the Cronbach's $\alpha$ values show sufficient reliability for each of the cultural worldview scales.

To measure political ideology, I asked respondents to self-identify on a 1 to 7 scale, with 1 = strongly liberal, 4 = middle of the road, and 7 = strongly conservative. The ideology scale has a _M_ = `r round(mean(beliefData$ideology, na.rm=TRUE),2)`, and a _sd_ = `r round(sd(beliefData$ideology, na.rm=TRUE),2)`. For partisanship, I asked respondents which party they most identified with, followed by how strongly they identified with that party. I combined the two questions into a 1 to 7 scale with 1 = strong Democrat, 4 = true independent, and 7 = strong Republican. Partisanship has a _M_ = `r round(mean(beliefData$partisan, na.rm=TRUE),2)`, and a _sd_ = `r round(sd(beliefData$partisan, na.rm=TRUE),2)`.

> - **ideology**: _On a scale of political ideology, individuals can be arranged from strongly liberal to strongly conservative. Which of the following best describes your views?_
> - **partisan**: _With which political party do you most identify? Do you completely, somewhat, or slightly identify with that party?_ 

To examine deep core beliefs related to the environment, I used three "pro-environment" statements from the NEP scale. As with the cultural worldview measures, respondents were asked to rate their agreement with the three statements on a 1 to 7 scale, and responses were averaged together into a single 1 to 7 scale. The combined scale has a _M_ = `r round(mean(beliefData$nepScale, na.rm=TRUE),2)`, _sd_ = `r round(sd(beliefData$nepScale, na.rm=TRUE),2)`, and a Cronbach's $\alpha$ = `r round(nepA$alpha,2)`. The statements are listed below, and they were randomized on the survey.  

> - **New Ecological Paradigm Scale**:
>     - _The balance of nature is very delicate and easily upset_
>     - _Humans live on a planet with very limited room and resources_
>     - _Humans are seriously abusing the environment_ 

For the policy core belief measures related to climate change, I examined whether respondents believe that climate change is happening (yes or no), and how sure they are that it is/is not happening (0 = Not at all sure, 1 = Somewhat sure, 2 = Very sure, 3 = Extremely sure). The questions, stated below, were combined into a nine-point scale with -4 indicating that respondents are _extremely sure_ that climate change is _not_ happening to 4 indicating that respondents are _extremely sure_ that climate change _is_ happening. The _happening_ measure has a _M_= `r round(mean(beliefData$happening, na.rm=TRUE),2)`, and a _sd_ = `r round(sd(beliefData$happening, na.rm=TRUE),2)`. 

In addition, respondents were asked about their perception of risks associated with climate change on a 0 (no risk) to 10 (extreme risk) scale, and the _risk_ measure has a _M_ = `r round(mean(beliefData$risk, na.rm=TRUE),2)` and a _sd_ = `r round(sd(beliefData$risk, na.rm=TRUE),2)`. Finally, I asked respondents their perceptions of the scientific consensus surrounding climate change. The _sciconsensus_ measure is dichotomous and has a _M_ = `r round(mean(beliefData$sciconsensus, na.rm=TRUE),2)` (_sd_ = `r round(sd(beliefData$sciconsensus, na.rm=TRUE),2)`) indicating that `r round(mean(beliefData$sciconsensus, na.rm=TRUE),2)*100` percent of respondents believe there is a scientific consensus on climate change. Exact question wordings and variable labels are below.

> - **happening**: _Do you think that climate change is happening? How sure are you that climate change [is/is not] happening?_ 
> - **risk**: _On the scale from zero to ten, where 0 means no risk and 10 means extreme risk, how much risk do you think climate change poses for people and the environment?_

I then created the `sciconsensus` dummy variable with 1 = Most scientists think climate change is happening, and 0 = all other responses.]

Finally, for secondary beliefs/policy preferences, I measured support for various policy approaches using a 1, strongly oppose to 7, strongly support scale. Policies were presented in random order.

> _Various policy solutions have been proposed as ways for the federal government in the United States to deal with climate change. Using a one to seven scale, where 1 is strongly oppose and 7 is strongly support, please indicate your support for each of the following policy proposals._

> - **IntAgree**: _Accept internationally-established limits on U.S. production of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases thought to cause climate change_
> - **Renew**: _Encourage research and development of renewable energy sources like solar or wind power_
> - **Nuclear**: _Expand the use of nuclear energy_
> - **Tax**: _A carbon tax that imposes a charge on coal, oil, and natural gas in proportion to the carbon they contain_
> - **EPA**: _Environmental Protection Agency regulations that limit the amount of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases that power plants can emit_
> - **CapTrade**: _A cap and trade program that sets an overall cap on emissions through allowances that can be bought, sold, or saved for future use_
> - **GeoEng**: _Encourage development of "geoengineering" technology such as filters that remove excess carbon dioxide from the air and high-altitude orbiting reflectors to reduce solar heating_ 

Overall, renewable energy has the highest mean at `r round(mean(beliefData$Renew, na.rm=TRUE),2)` (_sd_ = `r round(sd(beliefData$Renew, na.rm=TRUE),2)`). The next highest level of support is for US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) regulations at _M_ = `r round(mean(beliefData$EPA, na.rm=TRUE),2)` (_sd_ = `r round(sd(beliefData$EPA, na.rm=TRUE),2)`), followed by geoengineering at _M_ = `r round(mean(beliefData$GeoEng, na.rm=TRUE),2)` (_sd_ = `r round(sd(beliefData$GeoEng, na.rm=TRUE),2)`), and support for an international agreement at _M_ = `r round(mean(beliefData$IntAgree, na.rm=TRUE),2)` (_sd_ = `r round(sd(beliefData$IntAgree, na.rm=TRUE),2)`). For the two market-based approaches, support for a carbon tax has a _M_ = `r round(mean(beliefData$Tax, na.rm=TRUE),2)` (_sd_ = `r round(sd(beliefData$Tax, na.rm=TRUE),2)`), and support for cap-and-trade is _M_ = `r round(mean(beliefData$CapTrade, na.rm=TRUE),2)` (_sd_ = `r round(sd(beliefData$CapTrade, na.rm=TRUE),2)`). Finally, support for expanding nuclear energy has the lowest level of support at _M_ = `r round(mean(beliefData$Nuclear, na.rm=TRUE),2)` (_sd_ = `r round(sd(beliefData$Nuclear, na.rm=TRUE),2)`).     

## Belief System Network Analysis 

Examining belief systems as networks involves the same types of assumptions and analysis as examining other types of networks, such as social or informational networks. A network is composed of nodes (e.g., groups, individuals, information, beliefs) and edges, or ties that connect the various nodes. Additionally, networks can be directed, where the connections are only in one direction (**A** $\rightarrow$ **B**), or undirected with reciprocal relationships (**A** $\leftrightarrow$ **B**). Networks can be unweighted, where edges take on a binary value (i.e., a connection is present or not) or weighted, where the edges are assigned a value. In a belief system network, nodes represent observed variables, and the edges represent statistical relationships between them [@epskampEstimatingPsychologicalNetworks2018]. In addition, they are often weighted networks, and the values assigned to the edges are based on the strength of the relationship between the nodes. Finally, belief system networks are typically exploratory and therefore often assumed to be undirected [@costantiniStateARtPersonality2015].   

In the following analysis, I estimate the climate change belief system network using a Gaussian graphical model (GGM), a type of pairwise Markov random field (PMRF) model commonly used to examine psychological networks [@epskampBriefReportEstimating2017]. In a GGM, the edges of the network represent partial correlation coefficients that estimate the association between nodes while controlling for the other nodes in the network. The input for the GGM is a covariance matrix, but the network model is based on the inverse of the covariance matrix, which produces the partial correlation estimates [@epskampTutorialRegularizedPartial2018]. Polychoric correlation is used when the data contain ordinal variables. The model is a weighted network, and it is weighted by the strength of the partial correlations. It is then regularized using the "least absolute shrinkage and selection operator" (LASSO), which reduces the possibility of spurious correlations by reducing small coefficients to essentially zero [@brandtWhatCentralPolitical2019; @friedmanSparseInverseCovariance2008]. This approach is common in psychological network analysis because of the small sample size relative to the data needed to estimate network models [@epskampTutorialRegularizedPartial2018]. The LASSO requires a tuning parameter for regularization to manage the sparsity of the network. A common approach is to use an information criteria to select the appropriate parameter, such as the extended Bayesian Information Criterion (EBIC), which provides additional penalties for model complexity [@epskampBriefReportEstimating2017; @foygelExtendedBayesianInformation2010]. To estimate and illustrate the network, I use the `bootnet` and `qgraph` packages in `R` [@epskampQgraphNetworkVisualizations2012; @epskampBootnetBootstrapMethods2023].

The measures of centrality -- betweenness, closeness, and strength -- in the belief system network were calculated through a bootstrapping procedure using 1000 resamples of the data. The procedure was performed in `R` using the `bootnet` package [See @epskampBootnetBootstrapMethods2023; @epskampTutorialRegularizedPartial2018]. The bootstrap method results show the estimated centrality and the 95% confidence interval for each estimate.  

In the following analysis, I first examine the climate change belief network, which includes deep core beliefs (cultural worldviews, ideology, partisanship, NEP scale), policy core beliefs (climate change is happening, climate change risk, scientific consensus), and secondary beliefs/policy preference (support for various policy measures). Then, I explore the betweenness, closeness, and strength centrality measures of the nodes in the climate change belief network to identify which beliefs are most central.  

# Results

The results for the climate change belief network are shown in @fig-beliefNetNetwork. The results depicted in @fig-beliefNetNetwork show deep core beliefs in black, policy core beliefs in gray, and secondary beliefs/policy preferences in white. Additionally, positive partial correlations between nodes are represented by a solid line, and negative partial correlations are represented by a dashed line. Finally, the network is weighted, and the strength of the partial correlations is illustrated by the thickness of the edges, with thicker paths illustrating stronger correlations.

Overall, the network has 17 nodes and 89 (of 136) non-zero edges, or connections. Looking at the network overall, it seems that the cultural worldview measures are clustered together, the political belief measures are also clustered, the NEP scale is clustered with the policy core measures (i.e., climate change beliefs), and the secondary beliefs/policy preferences (i.e., climate policy measures) are clustered together, with the exception of nuclear energy. The directions of the relationships in the network are as expected, with deep core beliefs associated with climate beliefs, and both are associated with support for various climate policies. Finally, some of the stronger associations in the network are between partisanship (more Republican) and ideology (more conservative); beliefs that climate change is happening is strongly associated with beliefs about the scientific consensus as well as beliefs about the risks of climate change; the various policy measures (aside from nuclear energy) are also highly correlated, particularly support for renewable energy and geoengineering; and the cultural worldviews of hierarchy and individualism as well as egalitarian and fatalism are highly correlated. After visualizing the network, I next examine various centrality measures within it. The results of the bootstrap procedure for estimating the centrality measures and the 95% confidence intervals are shown in @fig-cent.

![Measures of Network Centrality](centralPlots.png){#fig-cent}

Looking first at betweenness centrality, as shown in @fig-cent, egalitarianism is the node with the highest betweenness centrality, by a wide margin, with `r round(betw_centO$mean[1], 2)`. Next is climate change risk perceptions at `r round(betw_centO$mean[2], 2)`, followed closely by fatalism at `r round(betw_centO$mean[3], 2)`, and individualism with `r round(betw_centO$mean[4], 2)`. Nodes high in betweenness sit on the shortest path between the other nodes in the network and act as a bridge between other beliefs; therefore, egalitarianism works to connect beliefs in the network. 

Also shown in @fig-cent, egalitarianism has the highest closeness centrality with `r round(close_centO$mean[1], 5)`, followed by support for an international agreement to address climate change at `r round(close_centO$mean[2], 5)`. Beliefs high in closeness are more closely connected to other nodes, so they have the shortest paths to them, which allows them to be influential in the network. 

Finally, looking to strength centrality, support for EPA regulations has the highest degree of strength centrality, followed by perceptions of the risk posed by climate change, and support for an international agreement to address climate change. Strength centrality reflects the sum, using absolute values, of weighted connections. The EPA node has the highest degree of strength centrality among the nodes in the network, with `r round(str_centO$mean[1], 2)`. Of note, the highest partial correlation coefficients for the EPA node included the policy support variables international agreement at _r_ = `r round(beliefNetNetwork$results$optnet[11,15], 3)`, carbon tax at _r_ = `r round(beliefNetNetwork$results$optnet[14,15], 3)`, and renewable energy at _r_ = `r round(beliefNetNetwork$results$optnet[12,15], 3)`, as well as the NEP scale at _r_ = 0.13. The support for an international agreement had a strength centrality of `r round(str_centO$mean[2], 2)` and, similar to EPA regulations its strongest partial correlations were with the other policy support measures including EPA regulations (`r round(beliefNetNetwork$results$optnet[15,11], 3)`), a carbon tax (`r round(beliefNetNetwork$results$optnet[14,11], 3)`), cap-and-trade (`r round(beliefNetNetwork$results$optnet[16,11], 3)`), and geoengineering (`r round(beliefNetNetwork$results$optnet[17,11], 3)`) as well as policy domain belief of climate change risk (`r round(beliefNetNetwork$results$optnet[9,11], 3)`) and the core belief of egalitarianism (`r round(beliefNetNetwork$results$optnet[1,11], 3)`). Finally, the climate change risk node had a strength centrality of `r round(str_centO$mean[3], 3)`. It was most highly correlated with the other policy core beliefs, including the belief that climate change is happening and that there is a scientific consensus on climate change. 

# Discussion and Conclusion 

Climate change is a polarized issue among the US public as beliefs about climate change diverge among the public. Beliefs about climate change form an interconnected belief system. One way to understand belief systems is through a hierarchical approach in which foundational, abstract beliefs influence other beliefs about specific issues and policy approaches. Another way to understand the structure of belief systems is as a network, with beliefs as nodes and connections between beliefs as edges.

In this paper, I used original survey data from a quota-based sample of the US public to examine the belief system network associated with climate change. Additionally, I drew on the leading influences of climate change views identified in the literature, including political beliefs, cultural worldviews, pro-environment orientation, acceptance of the scientific consensus, and solution aversion, to posit hypotheses about which beliefs would be the most central in the network using the common measures of centrality, including betweenness, closeness, and strength.

The results matched many of the expectations regarding the centrality of different types of beliefs within the climate change belief network. Looking at the centrality measures, I found that cultural worldviews (a deep core belief), support for various policy approaches (secondary beliefs), and perceptions of the risks posed by climate change (a policy core belief) were the most central types of beliefs in the network. These findings support expectations regarding core beliefs (H1), particularly cultural worldviews, as well as expectations of solution aversion (H3). However, less support is found for the scientific consensus as a gateway belief expectation (H2), as agreement with the scientific consensus did not show a high level of centrality across any of the measures. If the scientific consensus were a gateway belief, it would have likely had a high level of betweenness centrality. This is not to say that beliefs about the scientific consensus are unimportant, rather that they don't appear to be as central to the climate change belief system network as other beliefs.    

For the measures of closeness and betweenness centrality, egalitarianism was the most central node in the network. Closeness and betweenness centrality both address the lengths of the paths between nodes, with closeness meaning that a node influences other nodes because of its short path, and betweenness meaning that a node is influential because it sits on the path between other nodes. Beliefs high in closeness and betweenness act as gateways to other beliefs. These findings are consistent with the notion that cultural worldviews are deep core beliefs that influence other beliefs. Egalitarianism in particular has been shown to be associated with environmental and climate change views [@ellisSeeingGreenCultural1997; @grendstadCulturalTheoryPostmaterialism1997; @jonesLeadingWayCompromise2011; @nowlinCulturalTheoryPartisanship2020; @xueCulturalWorldviewsEnvironmental2014; @nowlinWhoShouldMore2022]. Additionally, the betweenness centrality finding of egalitarianism is also consistent with cultural cognition, in which cultural worldviews shape not only _what_ people think but also _how_ they think and process information about political and policy concerns [@kahanCulturalCognitionConception2012; @kahanCulturalCognitionScientific2011; @kahanPolarizingImpactScience2012]. 

Strength centrality is calculated as the sum of the absolute values of the weighted edges, and the sum reflects either the node with the strongest correlations and/or the node with the highest number of edges. As shown in @fig-cent, the EPA node has the highest strength centrality, followed closely by the climate change risk node, and finally the international agreement node. The strength centrality of views about EPA regulations and an international agreement to address climate change support the importance of solution aversion -- opposition to climate policies -- within the climate change belief system.

Finally, the results showed that the centrality of the various beliefs differed across the centrality measures. As noted, egalitarianism had a higher level of betweenness and closeness centrality, whereas EPA regulations had the highest level of strength centrality. This suggests that different types of beliefs likely serve distinct functions within a belief system. The functions of a belief in a network may be multifaceted and/or vary across policy issues, meaning that a hierarchical approach may be appropriate for some issues and contexts but not for others. For example, in the climate change belief network examined here, egalitarianism, a deep core belief, acted as a bridge, connecting beliefs in the network, as indicated by the betweenness centrality measure. This finding is consistent with a hierarchical approach to belief systems, where deep core beliefs act as filters and constrain other beliefs. However, the strength centrality of EPA regulations is not, as a hierarchical approach would posit that such secondary beliefs would be on the periphery of the network, and deep core or policy core beliefs would be central. These results point to both deep core beliefs and policy beliefs being driving forces in the belief system, which would not be predicted by a hierarchical approach.  

While the results support expectations regarding the importance of various beliefs within the climate change belief network, several avenues for future research remain. Of note is how the various climate policy measures are highly correlated, with the exception of nuclear energy, which was only weakly positively correlated with support for cap-and-trade and a carbon tax, and weakly negatively correlated with support for renewable energy. However, support for nuclear energy was strongly positively correlated with individualism and weakly positively correlated with fatalism. This follows other research that has shown that views about nuclear energy are not associated with concern about climate change, even though nuclear energy is a low-carbon energy source [@hawesClimateSciencePolitics2022; @ter-mkrtchyanPortionsPortfoliosUnderstanding2022; @feldmanClimateChangePolarizing2018]. 

The results shown here illustrate the centrality of beliefs across the entire sample; however, it is possible that some subgroups have distinct belief networks, with different beliefs being more (or less) central than in the aggregate. For example, @caminaHubsBeliefNetworks2022 found that the structure of belief system networks varied across different subgroups, including liberals and conservatives, younger and older, and male and female. Looking specifically at climate change, @leeClimateChangeBelief2024 compared the belief system networks of Democrats and Republicans and found that they had a similar structure and density compared to independents and those with no party affiliation. Additionally, @stewartMappingRacialEthnic2024 found differences in network structure and belief centrality across racial groups, including Whites, Blacks, and Hispanics. Additional research with a larger sample size should examine possible differences in networks across the various cultural types.    

<!-- Future research should also explore the degree to which the climate change belief network may be dynamic and the implications of that dynamism. The results presented here are cross-sectional; however, @fishmanChangeWeCan2022 showed that over the course of the 2008 presidential campaign in the US, the political belief network of high knowledge respondents increased in density (i.e., strength of associations), whereas the density of low knowledge respondents remained static. These findings suggest that, for some, belief networks may change over time, which could mean that connections strengthen, as shown in @fishmanChangeWeCan2022, or that connections change as beliefs not previously associated with each other become linked. Examining climate beliefs as a network provides insights into which beliefs are central, which means that a change in those beliefs could impact the network as a whole, thus altering how climate change is understood.
